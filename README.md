<p>
Step 1: Welcome back! In this section we're going to be creating tickets as end users. But first, start by deleting the "Maintenance" department
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Step 2: And now jumping straight into it, we're going to use the link that takes us to the ticket creating page http://localhost/osTicket and create our very first ticket.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Step 3: Having Karen create the first ticket, fill out her name and email section. In the help desk section, set it to "Report A Problem/Business Critical Outage" because for this scenario, the entire mobile/online bankikng system is down. Be sure to put that in the "Issue Summary" section. For the actual ticket, come up with a breif story that fits the issue like the one pictured above in the example image.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Step 4: Log into the osTicket system as John and take a minute to observe that because we set him to "Read Only," he is not allowed to make any changes to the ticket at the moment. So testing this out, insert a note briefly explaining that so we can make sure we see it after logging in as someone else.

</p>
<p>
Step 5: Logging back into the admin panel, we are going to give John full access to the ticket
</p>

</p>
<p>
Step 6: Now that John has access to make changes to the ticket, we are first going to set the priority to "emergency." Briefly detail in the section below it
</p>

</p>
<p>
Step 7: Next, set the SLA plan to "Sev-A" to mirror the severity of the scenario
